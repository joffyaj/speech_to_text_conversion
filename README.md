TITLE : text to Speech conversion
code description : 
openai-whisper-For transcribing speech to text using OpenAI’s Whisper model.
noisereduce-For reducing background noise in audio recordings.
pydub-To convert audio files from various formats (e.g., MP3 → WAV).
ffmpeg-python-Backend required by pydub for handling audio conversions.
scipy.io.wavfile-To read and write WAV files.
numpy-For numerical audio data processing.
google.colab.files-To upload files directly in Google Colab.

MAIN USECASE:
Journalists or podcasters transcribing interviews recorded in noisy environments
Students recording lectures in classrooms
Call centers analyzing voice logs
Researchers working with real-world field audio
Accessibility solutions for the hearing impaired

 FEATURES:
Accepts any audio format: MP3, M4A, WAV, etc.
Converts to standard WAV format with proper sampling
Applies noise reduction using noisereduce
Transcribes using OpenAI Whisper (choose from tiny, base, medium, large)
Entirely cloud-based (Google Colab), so no local installation required

WORKING:

This project is built to convert spoken words into text, even when the audio isn't perfectly clear. Think of it like a smart assistant that can listen to a noisy audio file,
clean it up, and then write down exactly what was said — all in just a few steps.
*You upload an audio file — this can be in formats like MP3, M4A, or WAV. The system is flexible with what it accepts.
*The audio is first converted into a standard format (WAV, mono, 16kHz) using a tool called pydub. This step makes sure the audio is in a clean and readable form for the rest of the system to work with.
*Once the audio is ready, it goes through a noise reduction process using the noisereduce library. This step is like cleaning up a blurry image — but for sound. It removes background noise such as fans, cars, or crowd murmurs while keeping your voice intact.
*After the audio is cleaned, it’s passed to OpenAI’s Whisper model, which is one of the most accurate speech recognition systems available. Whisper “listens” to the audio and converts what it hears into plain text
*Finally, the transcribed text is printed out — ready to be read, saved, or used in your application.

FUTURE SCOPE:

Real-time Mic Input-Integrate with sounddevice on local machines to handle live speech
Speaker Diarization-Add support to label "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc., using tools like pyannote.audio
UI Integration-Build a web app using Streamlit or Gradio for user-friendly interaction
Multilingual Support-Whisper already supports multiple languages; auto-detect and transcribe accordingly
Timestamped Transcript-Extend using whisperx to get word-level timestamps


CONCLUSION:

This project demonstrates a practical, cloud-based way to transcribe noisy audio into text using the power of OpenAI Whisper and a few smart preprocessing steps. 
Whether you're capturing real-world speech for journalism, education, or accessibility, this tool makes high-quality transcription more accessible—even in imperfect environments.
The modular nature of the system makes it easy to extend further, and because it's implemented in Google Colab, it's beginner-friendly and instantly usable by anyone with a browser.
